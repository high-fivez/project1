This is the link to our webpage and repo.

## Purpose

The purpose of this webpage is to allow the user to input one or two ingredients and receive a list of different cocktails that contain those ingredients. Then the user can click on the cocktail and get a photo, the recipe, and instructions for said cocktail. The user could also save the chosen cocktail to their favorites and view previous cocktails they have saved.

## My Experience

Our experience creating this webpage was a bit challenging due to it being a mix of HTML, Tailwinds CSS, and JavaScript. It taught us how to use API's as well as debug issues that would arise. This also showed us how the API dictates what we can and cannot do.
