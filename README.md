This is the link to our webpage and repo.

## Purpose

The purpose of this webpage is to generate a webpage that allows the user to input two ingredients and receive a list of different cocktails that contain those ingredients. Then the user can click on the cocktail and get the recipe and instructions for said cocktail. The user could also save the chosen cocktail to their favorites and view previous cocktails they have saved.

## My Experience

My experience creating this webpage was a bit challenging due to it being a mix of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It taught me how to use API's as well as debug issues that would arise.
